# R, R Markdown, and Quarto

## What is markdown?

- Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating HTML (and other formatted) 
documents.

- Markup languages are designed to produce documents from human readable 
text (and annotations).

- Some of you may be familiar with LaTeX. This is another (less human 
friendly) markup language for creating pdf documents.

- Why markdown is great:

  - Easy to learn and use.
  - Focus on **content**, rather than **coding** and debugging **errors**.
  - Once you have the basics down, you can get fancy via HTML, JavaScript, 
    and CSS.
  - Used by R Markdown, Jupyter Notebooks, and Quarto

R Markdown:

```{{r setup, include=FALSE}}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{{r cars}}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{{r pressure, echo=FALSE}}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{{r}}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this 

```{{r}}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

## R Markdown resources

- In RStudio, go to `Help > Cheatsheets` and select
    - R Markdown Cheat Sheet
    - R Markdown Reference Guide
    
- Check out the official R Markdown book: 
  [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) 
  by Yihui Xie, J. J. Allaire, and Garrett Grolemund
  
- Check out 
  [bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) by Yihui Xie.

- Take a look at [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/) web published R Markdown documents.


## Quarto resources

- Much of the syntax is shared with R Markdown - so previous resources are a good place to start

- [quarto.org](https://quarto.org/)

# Quarto / RMarkdown demo


## R packages

- Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include
  reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, 
  and sample data.

- In the following exercises we'll use the `tidyverse` package.

  - The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for 
    data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, 
    and data structures.
  - The core tidyverse packages consists of `ggplot2`, `tibble`, `tidyr`, 
    `readr`, `purrr`, `dplyr`, `stringr`, and `forcats` packages.
    
- This package is already installed for you on the DSS servers. If needed, you
  can install it by running the following in the `Console`:
  ```{r eval=FALSE}
  install.packages("tidyverse")
  ```



## A note on environments

- Your R Markdown / Quarto document and your Console do not share their global environments.

  - This is different than the computational model of Jupyter Notebooks!

- This is good for reproducibility, but can sometimes result in frustrating 
  errors.

- This also means any packages or data needed for your analysis need to be loaded in 
  your R Markdown document as well.



## Unvotes data analysis

To get started,

- open `examples/unvotes.qmd`,

- try Rendering the entire document and examine the results.

- try changing one or more of the selected countries, re-render the document and observe any changes.
  
- commit and push your changes to GitHub

<br/>


## R Markdown / quarto suggestions

- Remember to name your code chunks

- Familiarize yourself with chunk options (https://yihui.org/knitr/options/)
    - Use global chunk options to reduce duplication
    - Using `#|` syntax enables tab completion for chunk options

- Load packages at the start of a document, generally the chunk after your
  setup chunk

- Familiarize yourself with various output formats: 
  Make slides with `revealjs`, pdfs, books, etc.
